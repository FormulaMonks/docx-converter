## OpenXML Elements

- `<p>`: paragraph
- `<rPr>`:
- `<r>`: "runs" or, text sequence, inside a paragraph that contains no other element (e.g., bold, table, italics, etc)
- `<t>`: the text inside an `<r>`
- `<b />` & `<bCs />`: both were added when I set some text to be bold
- `<proofErr>`: warnings about grammar issues and similar
